Here are the most important things I can tell you about working with me in the 45 seconds I have your attention:

I'm ENFP.  Read about it here: https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality

The reasons I'm not living on a mountain (stack ranked) are:
  - Starcraft latency
  - Prime Now
  - I need to know that I made a difference in your life because I showed up.

Elevator pitch: "I empower everyone to do the most fulfilling work of their career by helping them discover that they had it in themselves all along."

I have three neurological problems that continue to defy modern science:
  - Love public speaking
  - Compulsion to fuck with the status quo just to see what happens (see what I did there)
  - Compulsion to understand how and why things, systems, and people work
  - A 3 year old humanâ€™s cognitive ability for things like date/time, left/right, and counting

I was in something in the sky that exploded and now have titanium/UHMWPE upgrades in my spine, and CRPS.  AMA.

If I'm interviewing you:
  - I'm not trying to make you fail.  I'm trying to help you pass.
  - You're interviewing me, too.  Let me know how I can pass.
  - Most people don't pass.  It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you.  I'm going to work on the answer with you so you can pass next time.  I don't want you to fail the kind of interview I give you twice.

If we're working together in any capacity:
  - I'm sorry.
  - If I think you can do something better, I'm going to tell you right away.  Please do the same for me.
  - I'm your cheerleader.
  - I'm more concerned with your success (however you measure it) than the company's.
  - I only want to work at companies that are full of successful, happy people.  This requires maintenance effort.
  - I expect you to set an example by working after hours or on PTO only if truly necessary.
  - I expect you to treat everyone as if they're a human.
  - I value participation, effort, and fun more than being right or avoiding mistakes.

If I see signs of substance abuse or depression in your behavior, I'm going to tell you that you're supported and that you can ask for help if you want it.  It's not your fault.

All of the above applies if I'm managing you, you're managing me, or I just see you in the break room.  I treat everyone the same.  Unless you play Protoss.

I measure my success by people telling me that I made a difference for them in some way.  Schedule a meeting with me or invite me for coffee.  It makes me feel useful and is the most important thing I can do with my time.  If nothing else, I make a great rubber duck.

Quack quack.
